#In this SQL, I'm querying multiple tables with respect to facilities, members, and their booking statistics. 

#1.	What facilities charge a fee to members that is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost?
SELECT facid,name,membercost,monthlymaintenance
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost !=0 AND membercost < ((1/50.0)*monthlymaintenance)

#2.	Which facilities has the word 'Tennis' in their name?
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%'

#3.	What are the details of the facilities with ID 1 and 5?
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
WHERE facid IN (1,5)

#4.	Which members joined after the start of September 2022?
SELECT * FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate >= '2022-09-01' 

#5.	What are the 10 surnames in the members table that first joined?
SELECT DISTINCT surname,joindate
FROM cd.members
ORDER BY joindate DESC
LIMIT 10

#6.	What is the signup date of the last member?
SELECT MAX(joindate) FROM cd.memebers
LIMIT 1

#7.	How many facilities have a guest cost of 10 or more?
SELECT COUNT (guestcost) FROM cd.facilities
WHERE guestcost >= 10

#8.	What is the total number of slots booked per facility in the month of September 2012, sorted by the number of slots?
SELECT facid, sum(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM cd.bookings
WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01' AND starttime < '2012-10-01'
GROUP BY facid
ORDER BY SUM(slots);
*In this WHERE statement, I added an extra day into the future to count for how PostgreSQL may account for time. This ensures better accurate results.

#9.	What are facilities with more than 1000 booked, sorted by facility id?
SELECT facid, SUM(slots) AS total_slots
FROM cd.bookings
GROUP BY facid
HAVING SUM (slots) > 1000
ORDER BY facid

#10.	What are the start times of bookings for tennis courts, for the date of '2012-09-21'?
SELECT cd.facilities.name,cd.bookings.facid,starttime
FROM cd.facilities
INNER JOIN cd.bookings
ON cd.facilities.facid = cd.bookings.facid
WHERE cd.facilities.facid IN (0,1)
AND cd.bookings.starttime >= '2012-09-21' 
AND cd.bookings.starttime < '2012-09-22' 
ORDER BY cd.bookings.starttime

#11.	What are David Farrell's booking start times?
SELECT starttime,surname,firstname
FROM cd.members
INNER JOIN cd.bookings
ON cd.members.memid = cd.bookings.memid
WHERE surname = 'Farrell'
