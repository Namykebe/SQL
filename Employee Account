# For this project, I fabricated my own data.
# I then created a table to insert data into it, for the purpose of showcasing table creation.
# Lastly, I performed one analysis on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE account(
	user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR (250) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	last_login TIMESTAMP
)

#Next, I then inserted data into the table.

#Lastly, I performed the following SQL.

#This code outputs the last 10 usernames that last signed in recently. 
SELECT username FROM account
ORDER BY username desc
LIMIT 10;
